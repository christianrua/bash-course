# Description
# Scrip for make a backup from the root directory

# Usage 
# just run the script so far

# Because the script will be shared with others in your organisation, your script should have the following permissions:
# The file owner (i.e you) should have read, write, and execute permissions.
# Everyone in the fileâ€™s group (i.e. your colleagues) should have read and execute permissions. For security purposes, they should not have write permissions.
# Everyone else in the organisation should only have read permissions.
# the resulting permission is 754
